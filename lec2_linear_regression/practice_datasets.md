# Practice datasets for linear regression

The best way to learn linear regression is to practice on real datasets. Here are a few datasets you can use to do that.

1. https://www.kaggle.com/ophi/mpi

Is MPI Urban related to MPI Rural?

2. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG

Predict the fuel efficienty of a vehicle.

Some transformations to prevent you from getting stuck:

```bash
sed -i 's/ \+/\t/g' auto-mpg.data
sed -i 's/?/0.0/g' auto-mpg.data
```
and when reading data, you can add headers as follows:

```python
orig_data = pd.read_csv('auto-mpg.data', sep="\t", header=None, names=["mpg", "cylinders", "displacement", "hp", "weight", "accel", "model year", "origin", "name"])
```

3. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data

Predict particulate matter in the air

Helpful transformation:

```bash
sed -i '/NA/d' ./china_pm_data.csv
```

4. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant

Predict power generated by the power plant

The data has `xls` or `ods` file. If you export all the sheet into multiple files, you can read all of them into one dataframe as follows

```python
orig_data = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f) for f in glob.glob('Folds5x2*.csv')], ignore_index = True)
```
